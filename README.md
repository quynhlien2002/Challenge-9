# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Challenge 
In this challenge for this week, we require to use node.js, javascript and what we learned in the previous week to make a README generator from terminal. 

## User Story 
As a user, I want to have a place where I can make a README file easy and faster to save time. 

## The Logic 
Given that I want to create a README file, 
When I open the terminal and type node index.js,
Then I want the terminal to ask me question that need for the file
When I answer all the questions, 
Then I want a command line to say "Success, README.md is created"
When I open my VS Code and go to the folder, 
Then I want to see a new README.md file with all the information that I had input

## How it should look like?
When open the terminal, we should put like this:
